# Loan_Approval_Prediction


Loans are the major requirement of this modern world. Banks get a major part of the total profit by this. It is beneficial for students to manage their education and living expenses, and for people to buy any kind of luxury like houses, cars, etc.
Banks have to look after many aspects when it comes to deciding whether the applicantâ€™s profile is relevant to be granted with loan or not.
Predicting loan approval is a common application of machine learning in the financial industry. 
As I am studying Introduction to Machine Learning course, I decided to hone my skills by building a model for loan approval prediction using Logistic Regression. 

The dataset has 13 columns and it was taken from kaggle.

I have followed the steps below:

**1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
                        I gather historical loan data, which should include both approved and denied loans.
                        I cleaned and preprocessed the data by handling missing values, outliers, encoding categorical variables, and scaling/normalizing numerical features.
        
**2. Exploratory Data Analysis:** I Checked the number of rows and columns, data types, and the presence of missing values.
                        -

**3. Data Splitting:** I Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
                        * 

**4. Model Selection and Training:** I have used  Logistic Regression that is common algorithms for  binary classification problems.I Trained the chosen model on the training data.
   
**5. Model Evaluation:** I evaluated the model's performance by using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
                   
  
**Results:**  The project achieves an accuracy of around 93% using a logistic regression model. Further improvements can be made by feature engineering and exploring different algorithms.
